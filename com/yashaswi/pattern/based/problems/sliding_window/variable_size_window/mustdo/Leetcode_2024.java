/**
 * chat gpt help
 * Initialize two pointers, start and end, both at the start of the string. Use a counter to track the number of 'F's in the current window.
 *
 * Expand the window by moving end to the right, one character at a time. If the count of 'F's exceeds k, move the start pointer to the right to reduce the number of 'F's until weâ€™re back within the k limit.
 *
 * Detailed Walkthrough:
 *
 * Window [0:0] ("T"):
 *
 * Count of 'F's = 0 (within k=1)
 * Current length of consecutive 'T's = 1
 * Window [0:1] ("TT"):
 *
 * Count of 'F's = 0 (within k=1)
 * Current length = 2
 * Window [0:2] ("TTF"):
 *
 * Count of 'F's = 1 (within k=1)
 * Current length = 3
 * Window [0:3] ("TTFT"):
 *
 * Count of 'F's = 1 (within k=1)
 * Current length = 4
 * Window [0:4] ("TTFTT"):
 *
 * Count of 'F's = 1 (within k=1)
 * Current length = 5
 * Window [0:5] ("TTFTTF"):
 *
 * Count of 'F's = 2, which exceeds k=1.
 *
 * To bring the 'F' count back within k=1, move start to 1. The window becomes "TFTTF".
 *
 * Count of 'F's = 2 (still exceeds k=1).
 * Move start to 2. Now the window becomes "FTTF".
 *
 * Count of 'F's = 2 (still exceeds k=1).
 * Move start to 3. The window becomes "TTF".
 *
 * Count of 'F's = 1 (now within k=1).
 * Window length is now 3 (from index 3 to 5).
 * Window [3:6] ("TTFT"):
 *
 * Count of 'F's = 1 (within k=1)
 * Current length = 4
 * Window [3:7] ("TTFTT"):
 *
 * Count of 'F's = 1 (within k=1)
 * Current length = 5
 * After expanding the entire window, the maximum consecutive 'T's length is 5 (achieved with "TTFTT" by changing one 'F' to 'T').
 *
 * Part 2: Maximize Consecutive 'F's
 * Using a similar approach, we would find the maximum consecutive 'F's by flipping 'T's to 'F'. However, the longest sequence we can achieve here is less than 5.
 *
 * Conclusion
 * The longest possible sequence of consecutive identical characters is 5 'T's, so the answer is 5.
